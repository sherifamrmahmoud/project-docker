# Three-Tier Application Architecture with Docker

Welcome!

This project showcases a robust three-tier application architecture using Docker. It consists of a backend service, a database, and a proxy server, all designed to work seamlessly together. Below, you'll find an overview of the project's structure and instructions for setting it up.

## Project Overview

- **Backend Service:** Utilizes a multi-stage Dockerfile to streamline the build process and optimize performance.
- **Database:** Configuration and credentials are managed securely on the host machine, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.
- **Proxy Server:** Configured to operate over HTTPS, with all necessary configuration files also located on the host machine for ease of management.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Backend Build:** The multi-stage Dockerfile approach minimizes build time and reduces the final image size.
- **Isolated Networking:** Each component (backend, database, and proxy) is deployed on separate Docker networks, enhancing security and maintainability.
- **Unified Deployment:** The entire stack can be managed with a single command, simplifying the deployment and teardown process.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Backend Service:**
   - The backend is defined by a multi-stage Dockerfile located in the project root. This design ensures a clean and efficient build process.

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Store your database credentials securely on your local machine. Ensure these credentials are referenced properly in the Docker Compose or environment configuration files.

3. **Proxy Server:**
   - The proxy is set up to use HTTPS, with all related configuration files stored on your host machine. This setup ensures secure communication between services.

4. **Networking:**
   - Each container is assigned to a distinct Docker network to ensure isolation and reduce potential conflicts. Verify network configurations in the Docker Compose file or similar setup.

5. **Managing the Application:**
   - Bring the entire application online or take i
